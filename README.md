# dxvk-gplasync
https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async updated for newer dxvk versions

# Improvements
- Compatible with dxvk 2.1
- Async can be used at same time as graphics pipeline library.
- Shader cache works with async (async+gpl is unknown as radv does not support shader cache with gpl currently)
